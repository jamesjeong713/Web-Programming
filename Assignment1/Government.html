      <h3>Federal State</h3>
      There are federal, provincial, territorial and municipal governments in Canada.
      The responsibilities of the federal and provincial governments were defined in 1867
      in the British North America Act,
      now known as the Constitution Act, 1867.

      In our federal state, the federal government takes responsibility for matters of national
      and international concern.
      These include defence, foreign policy, interprovincial trade and communications, currency,
      navigation, criminal law and citizenship.
      The provinces are responsible for municipal government, education, health, natural resources,
      property and civil rights, and highways.
      The federal government and the provinces share jurisdiction over agriculture and immigration.
      Federalism allows different provinces to adopt policies tailored to their own populations,
      and gives provinces the flexibility to experiment with new ideas and policies.

      Every province has its own elected Legislative Assembly, like the House of Commons in Ottawa.
      The three northern territories, which have small populations, do not have the status of provinces,
      but their governments and assemblies carry out many of the same functions.
      <br />
      <br />
      <h3>Parliamentary Democracy</h3>
      In Canada’s parliamentary democracy, the people elect members to the House of Commons in Ottawa
      and to the provincial and territorial legislatures. These representatives are responsible for passing laws,
      approving and monitoring expenditures, and keeping the government accountable.
      Cabinet ministers are responsible to the elected representatives, which means they must retain the
      “confidence of the House” and have to resign if they are defeated in a non-confidence vote.

      Parliament has three parts: the Sovereign (Queen or King), the Senate and the House of Commons.
      Provincial legislatures comprise the Lieutenant Governor and the elected Assembly.

      In the federal government, the Prime Minister selects the Cabinet ministers and is responsible
      for the operations and policy of the government. The House of Commons is the representative chamber,
      made up of members of Parliament elected by the people, traditionally every four years. Senators are
      appointed by the Governor General on the advice of the Prime Minister and serve until age 75.
      Both the House of Commons and the Senate consider and review bills (proposals for new laws).
      No bill can become law in Canada until it has been passed by both chambers and has received royal assent,
      granted by the Governor General on behalf of the Sovereign.
      <br />
      <br />
      <h3>Constitutional Monarchy</h3>
      As a constitutional monarchy, Canada’s Head of State is a hereditary Sovereign (Queen or King),
      who reigns in accordance with the Constitution: the rule of law. The Sovereign is a part of Parliament,
      playing an important, non-partisan role as the focus of citizenship and allegiance, most visibly during
      royal visits to Canada. Her Majesty is a symbol of Canadian sovereignty, a guardian of constitutional
      freedoms, and a reflection of our history.

      The Royal Family’s example of lifelong service to the community is an encouragement for citizens
      to give their best to their country. As Head of the Commonwealth, the Sovereign links Canada to 53
      other nations that cooperate to advance social, economic and cultural progress. Other constitutional
      monarchies include Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Australia, New Zealand, The Netherlands, Spain, Thailand,
      Japan, Jordan and Morocco.

      There is a clear distinction in Canada between the head of state—the Sovereign—and the head of
      government—the Prime Minister, who actually directs the governing of the country.

      The Sovereign is represented in Canada by the Governor General, who is appointed by the
      Sovereign on the advice of the Prime Minister, usually for five years. In each of the ten provinces,
      the Sovereign is represented by the Lieutenant Governor, who is appointed by the Governor General on
      the advice of the Prime Minister, also normally for five years.
